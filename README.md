In this project, I use the speech_recognition package to transcribe the audio recordings.
With the transcription, I use langchain with the Wikipedia tool to generate a response.
With the response, I use Azure Text to Speech to generate an audio file.

To run the project, set up your keys on a .env file and run the command 'streamlit run main.py'
